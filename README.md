# Dehumidifier Control System
This project was one of my first university assignments.
It simulates a dehumidifier's behavior by processing pre-determined sensor values to determine 
whether to activate the dehumidifier in high or low energy mode, or to power off.
The program uses Python to implement basic control flow and decision-making logic.
